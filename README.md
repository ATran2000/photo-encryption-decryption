# photo-encryption-decryption

- Implemented a simple encryption/decryption program for digital pictures using C++ SFML Library.
- Produced pseudo-random bits by simulating a linear feedback shift register, and used the shift register to alter each individual pixel of the image, creating the encryption/decryption effect. 
- An example encryption image is provided in the repository. The input-file.png file is the image before encryption and the output-file.png file is the image after encryption.
