# photo-encryption-decryption

- Implemented a simple encryption/decryption program for digital pictures using C++ SFML Library.
- Produced pseudo-random bits by simulating a linear feedback shift register, and used the shift register to alter each individual pixel of the image, creating the encryption/decryption effect.
